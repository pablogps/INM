# Project CrowdAI

This project explores interactive and collaborative evolution of neural network controllers for Minecraft agents. Interactive means that it will be the users that guide evolution, and collaborative that they can save their controllers and continue evolution where others left off.

CrowdAI was a postdoc project by [Pablo Gonz√°lez de Prado Salas](https://gonzalezdepradosalas.weebly.com/) at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/), supervised by [Sebastian Risi](http://sebastianrisi.com/). It builds on our own work on [modular neural networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_kxyTDDOMQJZVpvdW1iNzl6SlU/view) ([Github repository](https://github.com/pablogps/EspNeat) here), which itself is an adaptation of [SharpNeat](https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat). We use [Project Malmo](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo) to interact with Minecraft.
