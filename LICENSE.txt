This project allows collaborative, interactive neuroevolution of Minecraft agents. Minecraft simulations and the interaction with them is handled by Project Malmo: https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo

Neuroevolution builds on a custom version of SharpNEAT: https://github.com/colgreen/sharpneat
In particular, we have adapted https://github.com/pablogps/MalmoNEAT, which itself builds on https://github.com/pablogps/EspNeat

Details of the modular framework can be found in Interactive Evolution of Complex Behaviours through Skill Encapsulation, González de Prado Salas and Sebastian Risi 2017 (found here: https://gonzalezdepradosalas.weebly.com/publications.html)
